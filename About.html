  <h2>Conception and Future of Costco</h2>
  <p>Costco began with a bold idea: to create a warehouse club that offers quality products at the lowest possible prices. The first location opened in Seattle in 1983, and it quickly became popular for its unique model—offering bulk items at wholesale prices to paying members.</p>
  
  <p>Looking forward, Costco continues to expand globally while focusing on sustainability, efficient supply chains, and improving the member experience. The company is investing in green energy, digital shopping options, and expanding into new markets around the world.</p>
