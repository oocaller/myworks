 	<h2>Costco Membership Policy</h2>
 	<p>To shop at Costco, customers must have a valid membership. Costco offers two main types of memberships: Gold Star for individuals and Executive for those who want extra benefits like 2% annual rewards. Each membership is valid for one year and can be renewed annually. Members receive a physical or digital card that must be shown at the entrance and checkout. While non-members can browse the store or eat at the food court in some locations, only members can make purchases. Costco’s policy ensures exclusive savings, betterservice, and a trusted shopping experience for all members.</p>
